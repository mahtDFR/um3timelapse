unlimited bacon made this script in the um community years ago and after using it id like to make some improvements:

so far:

changed args to input prompts
add routine to take 3 extra frames to end of footage

to do:

add check for ffmpeg installation
delete temp files on completion or error
stop taking frames during heat up process
check if compatible with python 3.8







getting this when trying to delete temp files:

PermissionError: [WinError 32] The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process: 'C:\\Users\\MD44A~1.JAN\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\tmp8dzurcpe\\00023.jpg'



ffmpeg -r 30 -i -y -vcodec libx264 -preset veryslow -crf 18 test.mp4


response body during print
"pre_print" api state is when heating. should find a way to say not to do anything while this is happening

"printing" is when printing (duh)

"post_print"

"wait_user_action" (print aborted would you like to retry)
